Child Mortality Analysis

In demography, child mortality refers to the death of children under the age of five while infant mortality refers to the death of those under the age of one.
Child Mortality is an everyday tragedy of enormous scale that rarely makes the headlines. In many countries too many children die because of causes we know how to prevent and treat My aim in this project is to analyze the mortality rate over the last few decades and highlight the major factors affecting the same.

I am considering the following Hypothesis for my analysis:
 
Hypothesis 1: Child mortality has decreased over time.

As the mortality rate is decreasing, we fail to reject the hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2: Infant mortality rate decreases with increase in GDP per capita.

Due to the high negative correlation, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Hypothesis 3: Deaths due to several diseases has decreased over the years.

From the above chart, we can see the number of deaths due to multiple factors has decreased over the years. Hence, we fail to reject the hypothesis.

Hypothesis 4: Child mortality rate decreases with increase in health expenditure for all countries.

For the above countries, the mortality rate has increased with increase in health expenditure as percentage of GDP.

Since there are some countries where the mortality rate is increasing with increasing health expenditure, we reject the hypothesis.
